# Home-Electricity-Monitoring-and-Device-Controlling-System
A prototype design for remote home electricity monitoring and device control using a website

This is a simple client server model build using flask. The website can be used to monitor energy consumption from the different devices and the devices can also be controlled using the website. 

The User can also set a quota for electricity consumption. What is this quota?
The server will also have a forecasting module which will predict what will be the usage level for the upcoming days based on current usage patterns. If the usage patterns seems  to reach the quota set by the user, the user will be alerted via SMS.

Modules to be done:
 * Forecasting
 * Alerts
 * Hardware end of the project
